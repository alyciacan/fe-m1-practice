UX Question: Choose one question from each of these sections (so 5 total questions), and find one site that is good at supporting that question, and find another site that violates that question.

  1) Psychology: How much work does the user need to do?
  * https://www.google.com/flights is great at cutting down the work the user needs to do to the bare minimum: all I need to do is type in where I want to go and hit "enter". The page remembers my home airport, and dates aren't even necessary.
  * https://www.pearson.com/en-us/pearsonplus.html is a website that has multi-layered logins, difficult to parse links, and makes the user do way too much.

  2) Usability: Does it provide all the information a user needs to know?
  * https://bishops.co/locations/whiteaker/ is a weird website, because it isn't clear how many locations they have. This is important info the user needs. Of course, maybe it's intentionally only showing me the location closest to me, but I should have the option to change my location.
  * https://www.cafeyumm.com/ does a nice job of providing the most important info and making it easy to find all pertinent info.

  3) Design: Do colors, shapes, and fonts help people find what they want and improve the usability of the details?
  * https://www.superduperinc.com/ has lots of colors, but they don't seem to be used to group like items, and the site could use shapes to better effect to help "point" the user where they might need to go.
  * https://www.loccitane.com/en-us/ has done a great job of using typeface to make it easy to scan through lots of information.

  4) Copywriting: Does the copy sound confident and tell the user what to do?
  * https://www.halpinplumbing.com/?utm_source=GMBlisting&utm_medium=organic has actually done a pretty good job of using confident, direct copy to lead the user to contact them for scheduling.
  * http://rgsmithelectricandplumbing.com/ doesn't really tell the user what to do. There is information there, but there could be more direct instructions!

  5) Analysis: Lots of websites ask for feedback in the form of a survey. Additionally, they collect data when users visit, about whether they end up purchasing or contacting the company. This all can be used to inform the company whether their website is effective, and hopefully they are analyzing the data to improve outcomes!
