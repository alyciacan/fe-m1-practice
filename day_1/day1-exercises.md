1. On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
   The HTML code tells the browser about the structure and meaning of what appears on a web page.
2. What is the difference between an element and a tag?
   The terms are sometimes used interchangeably, although technically a tag is what is entered in brackets (e.g., <p> and </p>), while the element is the brackets and what comes in between them.
3. Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
   Attributes give more information about an element's content and include the attribute name and value.
4. Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
   The __body elements__ contain all contents of an HTML document, including the headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc. There is only one body in an HTML document. The __head element__ doesn't appear in the website anywhere- it contains only metadata. It appears between the <html> and <body> tags. The __title element__ is the title of the document and appears in the title bar or tab of the browser.
5. In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
   `opt` + `cmd` + `u`
6. List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
   <h1> is the "largest" heading type
   <i> makes text italicized
   <sup> makes text superscript
   <br /> is an empty element that inserts a line break
   <img> defines an image
7. What are empty elements?
   Empty elements only need one tag, and don't contain text (outside the angled brackets).
8. What is semantic markup?
   Semantic markup's real purpose is to provide information to search engines or screen readers. It may or may not change the visual appearance of the text, but that is not its primary purpose.
9. What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
   <abbr> indicates an abbreviation or acronym
   <dfn> shows a definition and is rendered (in some browsers) in italics
   <strong> indicates some content is of high importance
   <blockquote> indicates a section of text is quoted from some other source
   <s> indicates something is no longer accurate or relevant but not deleted. May show as struck through.
