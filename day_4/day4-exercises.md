## Ch 5 Qs
1. In an image element, why is the alt attribute important?
  The text in an alt attribute is what a text reader will read, for anyone who can't see the image.
2. What determines if an image element is inline or block?
  Where we stick the code for the image determines whether it will be inline or block. If the img element is written before a paragraph, for example, the image element will be block, and the text will be a new block. If the img element is within a paragraph or other block element, the img will be inline and have text flowing around it.
3. What are the benefits of jpg or png image file formats?
  JPG is a good choice if the image has a lot of colors. PNG (and GIF) work best if the image has only a few colors or large areas of a single color.

## Ch 16 Qs
1. What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?
  It's a good idea, design-wise, to use a sort of standardized set of image sizes (e.g., small-med-lg), rather than each image being a different size. By using CSS to set dimensions for each size, images can then be easily sized using the sizing scheme. 
2. What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?
  An image sprite is multiple versions of the same image layered together, so that only the necessary one is showing at any given time, but their position can change in response to rollovers or clicks.
